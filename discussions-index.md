Please use the links below to find the discussion threads that you are looking for. Shows are usually listed by the season of their start date. So, shows that run across multiple seasons, check the season during which episode 1 first aired. To confirm the season that a show would be listed under, look the show up on [AniList](https://anilist.co/) and the season and year will be listed in the information panel.
