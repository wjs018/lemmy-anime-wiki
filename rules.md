# Community Rules

The anime@ani.social community rules are laid out below. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to the moderator team or myself (wjs018@ani.social) directly.

## Post Topics

Posts must relate to anime or anime-related topics

The working definition we are working with for this rule is that a show/movie is considered anime if it has *either* a MAL page or an AniList page. Similarly, anime-related topics could include posts about animation studios, voice talent, musicians, or other industry personnel that have worked on anime projects in the past.

There are some topics that some might consider anime-related but are not allowed. An example would be video games that feature anime properties. Posts about these are not permitted in this community. Additionally, routine behind the scenes footage of industry talent like voice actors are not permitted. Posts about individuals should be about significant events (marriage, illness, death, etc.). For more typical behind the scenes footage, check out [!seiyuu@ani.social](https://ani.social/c/seiyuu).

If you are making a post intending on having a discussion about a show/topic that isn't covered by one of the other categories on this page, then please include some context, a discussion starter, or descriptive enough title to help foster discussion. Doing something like creating a post with the name of a show and no other comment/post body will simply be considered low-effort and spammy content and removed.

If you have a post removed and you feel it has been removed in error, feel free to reach out.

## NSFW Content

Do not post explicitly NSFW material

Posts containing heavily NSFW content is not allowed. What is or is not considered over the line is admittedly a subjective call made by the moderation team. In general, visuals that explicitly show genitalia or sexual acts would be over the line. Some non-hentai shows have nudity, so any post that has visuals featuring nudity (in a clip or screenshot) from these shows would need to be marked as NSFW or the post will be removed.

In the past, some posts have been allowed that discuss NSFW series, but do not feature any NSFW imagery. These posts are handled on a case by case basis and would need to be marked as NSFW when submitted.

Another edge-case that has occurred in the past is that a post links to an external page that is SFW, but has NSFW ads for some users. This is impossible to completely screen for and it is assumed that if the post is not marked as NSFW, that these explicit ads did not appear for the person making the post. If you run across this situation, please bring it to the attention of the mod team.

Finally, any content that contravenes the ani.social [Terms of Use](https://ani.social/legal) would be removed.

In general, the [!anime@ani.social](https://ani.social/c/anime) community is a fairly SFW community and the mod team's judgement on what constitutes NSFW may be tamer than some other communities that are more art-focused. Please use your best judgement when making posts/comments.

## Episode Discussion Threads

All discussion threads for currently airing media are made by the bot, [@rikka@ani.social](https://ani.social/u/rikka). If there is an issue with the bot for whatever reason, feel free to reach out to [@wjs018@ani.social](https://ani.social/u/wjs018). For additional information on why this is the case and how the bot works, see the links below:

- [Request a Discussion Post *How to make the bot work for you*](https://wiki.lemmyanime.com/en/rikka#requesting-discussion-threads-via-pm)
{.links-list}

## Full-Length Episode Posts

There are some series that post their episodes in a full, legally accessible way (usually via YouTube). For these series, a post can be made that links to the full episode as long as it falls into one of these three cases:

1. The episode aired within the past 30 days and no other discussion thread was made for it.

This would essentially be in place of a normal discussion thread created by the bot. Please make sure that your post title is descriptive enough that it is clear that your post is meant to be a discussion thread for that specific episode. Additionally, if you would be so kind as to let me know about the post so that I can make sure it is indexed by the bot so that it can be included in the wiki.

2. The episode was released more than 30 days ago and you want to have a discussion about something in the episode or write a recommendation the series.

This would be similar to a recommendation thread (or a [Watch This!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/guidetowatchthis) thread from the subreddit). The basic rule here is that in addition to simply posting the link, you also need to include some other content to contextualize or explain why you are posting this episode. This could be either in the post body or as a top level comment.

3. The episode is being posted as part of a community-organized rewatch.

Basically, this would be a user-led effort to gather a group of interested parties to all watch through a series together. If a series that was being rewatched had full, legally accessible episodes, then posts of the link to the episode could serve as the rewatch threads.

## Memes

Memes and image macros will be removed from the anime community. There are a couple of communities that are better suited for meme content.

- [!animemes@ani.social *General animeme community*](https://ani.social/c/animemes)
- [!anime_irl@ani.social *When anime gets a bit too real*](https://ani.social/c/anime_irl)
- [!linuxanimemes@ani.social *For all the tux fans out there*](https://ani.social/c/linuxanimemes)
- [!evangelionmemes@ani.social *Post the memes Genji*](https://ani.social/c/evangelionmemes)
- [!christiananimemes@ani.social *Spreading the gospel of animemes*](https://ani.social/c/christiananimemes)
{.links-list}

## Clip Posts

If you try to post a clip within a week after the episode/movie that the clip is derived from, it will be removed. Instead, if you want to share the clip, it would be more appropriate to share within the discussion thread for that episode/movie.

It is best practice to tag the clip post with the `[Clip]` tag to help users more easily search for clips that have been previously posted. The title of a clip post must include the name of the anime. If the clip features any explicit content, it needs to be marked as NSFW. Ecchi clips that don't explicitly show nudity should probably be marked as NSFW. Please use your best judgement.

At this point in time, there is neither a minimum nor maximum runtime that a clip must meet. This can change in the future if I feel there needs to be clarification. A good rule of thumb would be that a clip should probably fall between 1-5 minutes long. This provides enough content that it isn't simply a fancy gif, but not so much that it is a significant portion of the episode.

## Spoilers

Due to the federated and open nature of lemmy, different clients are going to render spoiler tags differently (or not at all). I have already written a guide on proper spoiler tagging expectations for the community [here](https://ani.social/post/992253) with more information.

- [Lemmy spoiler guide *Link to ani.social post*](https://ani.social/post/992253)
{.links-list}

As the lemmy platform evolves, the spoiler syntax may evolve with it. If there is a change to spoiler tagging expectations, there will be a meta post to the community detailing things and this page will be updated accordingly.

## Piracy

Piracy discussions should be directed elsewhere.

Piracy is a bit of an anime fact of life. Such is the case when the community deals with users dispersed across the globe and the tangled web of licensing agreements mean that many shows are simply unavailable to many users by any legal means.

However, discussion of piracy sites/methods/links should be directed towards a different community and risk being removed from the anime community.

- [!piracy@lemmy.dbzer0.com *General piracy community*](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/piracy)
- [!animepiracy@lemmy.ml *Specifically anime piracy community*](https://lemmy.ml/c/animepiracy)
{.links-list}

## Self-Promotion

I am not opposed to allowing people to post videos/articles/content that they made themselves. However, to engage in self-promotion in this way, there are some simple guidelines that you should follow:

1. **Be an active member of the community** - don't let the self-promo posts be the only thing you ever contribute to the community. I would be much more willing to allow self-promo posts if you are also consistently commenting on other posts or contributing other content like news articles/visuals/etc. or are a regular commenter in things like episode discussion threads or the weekly general thread. If all you ever do is make a self-promo post and then disappear, that will be removed.
2. **Engage with users on your self-promo** - if you make a post about something you made and get questions/comments on it, then please engage with those users and answer questions where possible
3. **If in doubt, ask the moderators** - if you are unsure if a self-promotion post is acceptable, then feel free to reach out in advance. The moderator team would be happy to help you if there are any issues.

## Be Civil

In general, if you make posts or comments that cause you to come off as a jerk or are mean towards others in the community or in general, then your posts risk being removed. Please don't resort to using language like slurs or disparaging others.

This is the catch-all, don't be a dick rule. So, just be nice to each other and enjoy anime together instead of getting angry. If you see comments or posts that you feel cross this line, then please use the report tool to let the moderator team become aware of them.

## Questions, Comments About the Rules

Feel free to reach out to the myself directly (wjs018@ani.social), or any other member of the moderation team if you have any questions about these rules. Alternatively, you can ask a meta question about rules in the pinned weekly thread. To help make it more visible to the moderators, please tag myself or another moderator in the comment.

You also have the option to make a [Meta] post about the rules in the community as long as you are civil in the discussion. This would be best used if you want to gather wider input from the community about a rule. Past discussion threads like this have led to changes to the rules, so don't feel like this would be a useless effort. I gladly welcome constructive criticism and am more than willing to admit when I am wrong or out of step with the rest of the community.
